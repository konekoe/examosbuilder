# examosbuilder

This repo is part of the ExamOS bundle. The scripts are derivatives of `archiso`, which is a utility used 
to build official Arch Linux install ISO-files.

## Future fixes:

This repo depends on the examos-delivery repository. This repo should be able to produce a minimal Arch Linux 
installation without the presence of for example the `examtool` package and `pacman.conf` pointing to a fixed 
location.
